        "The dataset simulates a fleet of 20 electric school buses operating through the first week of school in Fall 2023 (starting at 5am PT on Tuesday 9/5/2023 and finishing at 8pm PT on Friday, 9/9/2023). Each bus covers 2 routes per day, one in the morning to pick up students, and one in the afternoon to drop them off. The buses start from and return to the same charging depot before and after each trip, which is equipped with 5 industrial EV chargers, each with 5 charging ports. The charging depot also has on site solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and a battery (BESS) for energy storage. The total electricity cost is billed by the utility company operating the grid, and based on the power dispatched from the grid to the depot throughout each day.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this exercise, we are making the following assumptions:\n",
        "1. The charging depot is used exclusively by the 20 vehicles in the fleet\n",
        "2. Each vehicle is always paired with the same charging port when they are at the depot: no pairing optimization is required.\n",
        "3. Energy generated from on-site solar PV panels can be directly used by chargers, or stored in the on-site battery storage system (BESS) to be used by the chargers at a later time."

        "#### Time of Use Electricity Rates\n",
        "\n",
        "It's common for the utility companies to apply several different charges, referred to as \"rates\", to electricity billing. For each day in a billing period, a specific rate may be applicable only for certain time windows, and its pricing may depend on the expected load level at the time (e.g. peak hours vs off-peak hours). Usually, electricity used during peak hours, when the grid expects high load from its consumers, is charged at a higher pricing than off-peak hours, when the grid expects lower load from customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This kind of pricing is called **time-of-use (TOU) rates**. TOU rates incentivize consumers to shift the time of their flexible charging needs to from on-peak to off-peak hours, which helps improve the grid's energy efficiency through through increased utilization of excess energy generated during off-peak hours, and reduced peak loads, which reduces the cost associated with add extra generation capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two of the most common types of TOU charges are **energy rates** and **demand rates**. For a time window in which the rate is applicable, energy rates are calculated based on the total amount (kWh) of energy consumed, whereas demand rates are calculated based on the maximum power (kW) dispatched over the billing period. The power is measured over a short time window, typically 15 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>*Note: TOU rates are an example of demand-side management (DSM), which is the idea of managing the demand of electricity to match its supply in order to increase the grid's effiency. We refer the audience to [14] and [15] for an overview of DSM technologies and their benefits and challenges.*"

        "Using the synthetic school bus charging dataset, we demonstrated how ZEVi's MPC could trade off multiple common objectives in ZEV charging scenarios, and appropriately respond to feedback from the system through running multiple iterations of optimization with with a rolling time horizon. Compared with the eager charging baseline algorithm, ZEVi's MPC is able to substantially reduce the cost of operation for ZEV fleets, reducing the barrier of entry for fleets transitioning from ICEVs to ZEVs."

        "## 6.2 Limitations\n",
        "We list some limitations to the MPC algorithm demonstrated :\n",
        "1. We made the simplifying assumption of constant charging efficiency for each ZEV. In reality, ZEV battery charging effiency is a function of its state of charge (SOC), usually peaking at a relatively low SOC and tapering off as the battery approaches full.\n",
        "2. We disregarded factors impacting BESS performance, such as self-discharge and storage capacity degradation over time. Without charging or discharging, BESS loses its stored energy over time at a small rate due to its internal chemical process. This shouldn't have a big impact on the optimization given our relatively short simulation period of 4 days, but it's worth accounting for in a charging station's actual operation.\n",
        "3. An emerging lever that may help improve grid efficiency is vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which allows ZEVs to inject power from their batteries to the grid, helping fulfill demands and relieving the strain on the grid. V2G can also provide additional financial incentives to ZEV owners, in cases where the energy flow from ZEV to the grid is compensated. The MPC demonstrated in this tutorial does not consider V2G, which is an opportunity to further improve the optimization.\n",
        "4. The assumptions of the dataset (Section 2.2) limits the ZEVi MPC's use case to charging stations used by a fixed fleet of ZEVs, which means adjustments need to be made for the public charging use case, where there's an undetermined number of ZEVs that the charging station needs to support. [20] provides one example of using reinforcement learning to solve the public charging use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, one obvious limitation is our SAC implementation. We have not spent any significant amount of time implementing appropriate reward mechanism and tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates. The audience is encouraged to experiment with this demonstration and see how changing the rewards may affect the model's behavior.\n"

This prevents the vehicle not meeting its energy requirements from breaking any constraints, enabling the solver to always find a viable solution. However, it is important to note positive nonzero slack energy for a vehicle indicates that vehicle cannot meet the energy requirements for its trips with the pre-specified vehicle reliability buffer, $e_{buffer}^{m}$. The vehicle reliability buffer is an artificially imposed requirement that vehicle $m$ always have $e_{buffer}^{m}$ kWh more than its predicted energy need at each timestep, increasing its ability to cope with unforeseen events. Reducing the vehicle reliability buffer reduces the chance of nonzero slack, but increases the risk the vehicle cannot complete its trips in the case of unforeseen events.
