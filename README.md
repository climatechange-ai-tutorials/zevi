# Zero-Emission Vehicle Intelligence (ZEVi): Effectively Charging Electric Vehicles at Scale Without Breaking Power Systems (or the Bank)
This tutorial surveys different methods to formulate electric vehicle (EV) charging and energy dispatch as an optimization problem, using tools such as convex optimization, Markov decision process (MDP), and reinforcement learning (RL).
